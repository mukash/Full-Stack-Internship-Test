# Full Stack Developer Internship Test

Welcome to the Full Stack Developer Internship Test! This test is designed to assess your skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as your ability to implement conditional logic. Please follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.

## Frontend Task

Use any of these frameworks (React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js). You can also use simple HTML and CSS, but frameworks are preferred. Create a simple web page that allows users to enter their name and age. Upon submitting the form, display a greeting message with the user's name and age. P.S. Your creativity in design is most welcomed.

## Backend Task

1. Set up a RESTful API endpoint that receives POST requests containing user data (name and age) and returns a JSON response with a greeting message.
2. Use any backend technology of your choice (Node.js with Express, PHP with MySQL, etc.).

## Full Stack Task

Integrate the frontend and backend:

1. Configure the frontend to send POST requests to the backend endpoint you created.
2. Display the response from the backend on the webpage.
3. **Implement conditional logic (such as loops and if statements) in your frontend code to enhance the user experience. For example, you could validate user inputs before submitting the form or display different messages based on certain conditions.**

## Bonus Task (optional)

Implement basic form validation on the frontend to ensure that the user enters both a name and an age before submitting the form. You can also include additional validation such as checking if the age is a numeric value.
